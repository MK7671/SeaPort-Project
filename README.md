# SeaPort-Project
For this set of project, we wish to simulate some of the aspects of a number of Sea Ports.

Here's a very quick overview of the projects:
1. Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let the user search the structure.
2. Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently.
3. Create a thread for each job, cannot run until ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the progress of each job.
4. Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job.
