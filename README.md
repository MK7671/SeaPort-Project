# SeaPort-Project
For this set of project, we wish to simulate some of the aspects of a number of Sea Ports.

This projects have four different sections throughout the 8 week semester. This program reads text files that includes information about sea ports, docks, ships, and people, and then create the specified internal data structure. Depending on line of each text file, the program generates a world class that contains ArrayList of seaports, and each seaports contains four ArrayLists (docks, two type of ships, and people). After that, the program displays the internal data structure in a nice format in the GUI, and it begins to simulate ships arraiving at a dock and complete each job that requires a person with a special skillset if the person is at the port the ships docked at.

# Project Sections
1. Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let the user search the structure.
2. Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently.
3. Create a thread for each job, cannot run until ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the progress of each job.
4. Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job.
